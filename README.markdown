This is the source of the talk (to be) given at the WindyCity.pm meeting August 23, 2012 by Joel Berger.

In truth this talk is part 1, introducing [`Moose`](http://p3rl.org/Moose), [`Method::Signatures`](http://p3rl.org/Method::Signatures) and [`MooseX::Declare`](http://p3rl.org/MooseX::Declare). The second part will be my talk from YAPC::NA 2012 on [Modeling Physical Systems using Modern Object Oriented Perl](https://github.com/jberger/YAPCNA2012/tree/master/NumSim).
